# Study Notes

This is my personal knowledge base where I organize and store notes from various subjects and topics I'm learning or revising. Everything is neatly placed inside the `notes/` folder.

## Folder Structure

```

.
├── notes/
│   └── ...
└── README.md

````

All notes are kept inside the `notes/` directory and categorized by subject or topic. Each `.md` file represents notes for a specific concept or area.

##  Purpose

-  Keep track of everything needed a night before exam
- Easy to revise from one place

## How to Use

1. Browse the `notes/` folder to explore different topics.
2. Open any `.md` file to read the notes.
3. Clone the repo if you want a local copy:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EchoSingh/study-notes.git
   ````
