**Cybercrime – Definition and Origins of the Word Cybercrime and Information Security**


The term "cybercrime" traces its origins back to the word "cyber," which was coined by William Gibson in 1984 in his science fiction novel _Neuromancer_. In this context, "cyber" referred to a "consensual hallucination" or the "cyberspace," which is the conceptual space where human beings interact through networked computers.

The term "cybercrime" itself emerged from the term "cybernetics," coined by Norbert Wiener in 1948. Cybernetics is defined as the scientific study of the control and communication mechanisms in both machines and living organisms.

The definitions of "cybercrime" vary, but generally, it refers to an illegal act conducted in a computer or where the computer was directly or indirectly used. According to Webster Dictionary, crime is defined as "an act or the commission of an act that is forbidden by a public law and that makes the offender liable to punishment by that law". Cybercrime, specifically, is a criminal activity that involves a computer and the Internet to steal someone's identity or to sell contraband or stalk victims, or engage in malicious operations.

Cybercrime can be broadly classified in two ways:

1. **As a narrow definition:** This refers to crimes where the computer is the _role_ or _target_ of the crime.
2. **As a broad definition:** This encompasses crimes where the computer is the _environment_ or _context_ in which the crime occurs.

Examples of cybercrime in a narrow sense include hacking, computer sabotage, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and virtual child pornography. In a broad sense, examples include computer fraud, forgery, child pornography distribution, bank robbery, and drug trade.

##### Cybercrime and Information Security

Information security is fundamentally about protecting information, equipment, devices, computers, and associated networks from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. Cybersecurity, as a broader term, emphasizes safeguarding information, equipment, devices, computers, and their associated networks.

The increasing dependence on information and communication technology (ICT) and the widespread use of computers globally have brought numerous advantages but have also created avenues for misuse and opportunities for committing crimes. This has led to new risks for computer users and increased opportunities for social harm, with users, businesses, and organizations worldwide facing a constant threat from hackers.

In the context of cybercrime, information security focuses on preventing unauthorized access, protecting personal data (PII), and ensuring the integrity and availability of computer systems. The rise of cybercrime necessitates robust information security measures to counter threats like identity theft, financial fraud, and data breaches. Organizations must recognize the importance of cybersecurity because:

- They face internal costs associated with security incidents, such as loss of productivity, theft of intellectual property, and damage to reputation.
- They must implement security policies and controls to protect sensitive information.
- Cybercrime impacts various business functions, including human resources, accounting, and legal departments, making comprehensive information security crucial.

The challenge of information security in the age of cybercrime is significant due to:

- The ever-evolving nature of cyber threats.
- The large number of potential victims and the ease with which criminals can operate across geographical boundaries.
- The difficulty in estimating financial losses from cybercrime, as some organizations may choose not to disclose such incidents.
- The need for continuous vigilance and adaptation of security practices to combat new forms of attacks.

**Who are Cyber Criminals**

Cybercriminals are individuals or groups who commit illegal acts involving computers and the Internet12. Their activities can range from identity theft and financial fraud to malicious operations like selling contraband or stalking victims.

Cybercrime involves such activities as child pornography,credit card fraud,cyberstalking,defaming another online; gaining unauthorized access to computer systems; ignoring copyright, software licensing and trademark protection; overriding encryption to make illegal copies; software piracy and stealing another's identity (known as identity theft) to perform criminal acts.
Cybercriminals are those who conduct such acts. They can be categorized into three groups that reflect their motivation:

1. **Type I: Cybercriminals – hungry for recognition**
    
    - Hobby hackers;
        
    - IT professionals (social engineering is one of the biggest threats);
        
    - Politically motivated hackers;
        
    - Terrorist organizations.
        
2. **Type II: Cybercriminals – not interested in recognition**
    
    - Psychological perverts;
        
    - Financially motivated hackers (corporate espionage);
        
    - State-sponsored hacking (national espionage, sabotage);
        
    - Organized criminals.
        
3. **Type III: Cybercriminals – the insiders**
    
    - Disgruntled or former employees seeking revenge;
        
    - Competing companies using employees to gain economic advantage through damage and/or theft.

**Classifications of Cybercrimes**


Cybercrime encompasses a wide range of illegal activities that involve the use of computers and the internet. To understand and combat these offenses effectively, cybercrimes are classified into several categories based on the nature of the crime, the role of the computer, and the target (individuals, property, organizations, or society).

###### **1. Classification Based on Victim**

######## **1.1 Cybercrimes Against Individuals**

These crimes are targeted at specific persons, often with the aim of exploiting personal data, damaging reputation, or causing psychological harm. Common types include:

- **Email Spoofing**: This involves sending emails that appear to originate from a trusted source, but actually come from an unknown or fraudulent sender. The goal is usually to deceive the recipient into disclosing personal information or clicking malicious links.
    
- **Phishing and Spear Phishing**: Phishing involves sending fake emails or messages to trick individuals into sharing sensitive data such as passwords or banking details. Spear phishing is a more targeted version, customized to fool specific individuals.
    
- **Spamming**: The mass distribution of unsolicited emails, often used for advertising, spreading malware, or phishing.
    
- **Cyber Defamation**: Publishing false or harmful statements about someone on the internet to damage their reputation.
    
- **Cyberstalking and Harassment**: Persistent use of electronic communication to harass or intimidate someone.
    
- **Computer Sabotage**: The intentional destruction or disruption of a person’s data or computer system.
    
- **Pornographic Offenses**: The creation, distribution, or access of illegal sexual content, including content involving minors or non-consensual acts.

#####  **2. Classification Based on the Role of the Computer**

Cybercrimes can also be understood based on how the computer is involved in the crime. Table 1.1 in the divides cybercrimes into the following:

### **2.1 Computer as a Target (Narrow Sense)**

In these cases, the computer or the data stored on it is the direct target of the crime. Examples include:

- Hacking
    
- Computer sabotage
    
- Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks
    
- Virtual child pornography
    

### **2.2 Computer as a Tool**

Here, the computer is used as a medium or instrument to commit the crime. The device stores information or aids in executing the illegal act. Examples include:

- Online fraud
    
- Forgery
    
- Distribution of child pornography
    

### **2.3 Computer as the Environment or Context**

In this classification, the computer plays a supporting or peripheral role. It is not directly used to commit the crime but may help in planning, organizing, or recording evidence. Examples include:

- Using a computer to plan a robbery or drug trade
    
- Murder planned using internet-based tools or tracking
    
- Bank robbery assisted by digital surveillance tools
    

|**Role of Computer**|**Cybercrime in Narrow Sense**|**Cybercrime in Broad Sense**|
|---|---|---|
|**Computer as an Object**|Target of the attack (e.g., hacking, DDoS attacks)||
|**Computer as a Tool**|Medium to perform crimes (e.g., fraud, child porn)||
|**Computer as Environment/Context**|Not central to the crime, but part of it (e.g., murder, drug trade using tech)|Contains evidence or aids investigation|
