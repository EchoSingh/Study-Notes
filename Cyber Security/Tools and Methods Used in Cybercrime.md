Cybercriminals employ a structured approach to targeting computer systems, which involves several forms of attack.

**Forms of Attack:**

1. **Initial Uncovering (Reconnaissance)**: This is the preparatory phase, often referred to as "footprinting" in hacking. It involves gathering information about the target's environment and computer architecture to find intrusion points. This can be done passively by searching public websites, news articles, online community groups (like Facebook), organization websites, blogs, newsgroups, and even job postings to learn about employees. Network sniffing can also be used in this phase to gather information on IP address ranges, hidden servers, or services without the target's knowledge.
2. **Network Probe (Investigation)**: After initial reconnaissance, attackers use more invasive techniques like "ping sweeps" and port scanning to discover individual hosts and confirm information about IP addresses, operating system types, versions, and services running on the network. This is also called "Rattling the Doorknobs" or "Active Reconnaissance".
3. **Crossing the Line toward E-crime**: At this stage, attackers exploit identified vulnerabilities in the target system to gain unauthorized access, often aiming for "root access," which provides full system privileges.
4. **Capturing the Network**: This involves taking control of the network. The attacker quickly gains internal network access and may replace existing files and services with malicious ones, such as Trojan files with backdoor passwords.
5. **Grab the Data**: Once the network is compromised, the attacker proceeds to steal confidential data, credit card information, deface webpages, alter processes, or launch further attacks from the compromised network.
6. **Covering Tracks**: This final step aims to extend the misuse of the system without detection. Attackers meticulously hide their identity and erase any traces of illicit activity, such as deleting access logs. Tools like ELSave, WinZapper, Evidence Eliminator, Traceless, and Tracks Eraser Pro are used for this purpose.

**Types of Malicious Software and Deception Tactics:**

- **Scareware**: This is scam software that uses social engineering by displaying pop-up messages (e.g., "your computer may be infected with harmful spyware programs") to create anxiety and trick users into purchasing or downloading non-beneficial, often malicious, software. Some forms of spyware and adware use scareware tactics.
- **Malvertising**: This involves malicious advertising, where malware is hidden within advertisements or embedded into webpages, subtly installing unwanted media or other malicious software when users interact with them.
- **Clickjacking**: This technique tricks users into revealing confidential information or taking control of their system by clicking on seemingly innocuous webpages. It executes embedded malicious code without the user's knowledge.
- **Ransomware**: This is a type of malware that holds a computer system or its data hostage, demanding a ransom for its restoration. It typically propagates as a computer worm, entering systems through email attachments or network vulnerabilities, disabling essential system services, and encrypting personal files.

Attackers use various websites to obtain information on system vulnerabilities, including US-CERT, CVE, Secunia, Hackstorm, Hackerwatch, Zone-H, Milworm, OSVDB, Metasploit, LibExploit, Canvas, and Core Impact.

### Proxy Servers and Anonymizers

Proxy servers and anonymizers are crucial tools for cybercriminals to obscure their digital footprint and maintain anonymity.

**Proxy Servers:** A proxy server acts as an intermediary for connections between computers on a network. Its purposes include:

- **Hiding Identity**: It allows an attacker to conceal their IP address and identity.
- **Speeding Up Access**: It can cache webpages from a web server, thereby speeding up access to resources.
- **Filtering Content**: Specialized proxy servers are used to filter unwanted content, such as advertisements.
- **IP Address Multiplexing**: It can be used as an IP address multiplexer, allowing multiple computers to connect to the internet using a single IP address. Examples of websites offering free proxy services include proxy4free.com, proxz.com, anonymitychecker.com, surf24h.com, and hidemyass.com.

**Anonymizers:** An anonymizer, also known as an anonymous proxy, is a tool designed to make internet activity untraceable. It accesses the internet on behalf of the user, protecting personal information by hiding the source computer's identifying data. These sites are used by individuals who wish to avoid leaving traces of their identity online, thereby preventing unsolicited emails from spammers or contact from cyberstalkers. Websites providing anonymizer services include anonymizer.com, browzar.com, anonymize.net, and anonymouse.ws.

**Being Anonymous while Searching on Google:** When searching online, even common tools can record user data:

- **Google Cookie**: Google was one of the first search engines to use cookies, placing a unique ID number on a user's hard disk. This cookie reads and records the unique ID number each time a user visits Google, allowing Google to build a detailed list of search terms over many years. These cookies are set to expire in 2038 unless deleted by the user.
- **Cookie (HTTP/Browser Cookie)**: A small text file containing alphanumeric characters, used for storing website preferences or authentication. Attackers can exploit these cookies as "Spyware." Cookies can be persistent (stored on the PC's hard disk) or session-based (temporary, deleted when the browser closes).
- **DoubleClick**: A Google subsidiary that provides internet ad-serving services and paid search. It utilizes "DART cookies" to facilitate these services.
- **G-Zapper**: A utility that helps users maintain anonymity while searching Google. It protects users' search history and displays information about their Google cookie (installation date, tracking duration). G-Zapper allows users to automatically delete or block the Google search cookie from future installations, preventing it from compiling reports, tracking user habits, or testing features.
