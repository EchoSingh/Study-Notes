## **Computer Forensics and Steganography**

Computer forensics is a specialized field focused on the systematic identification, acquisition, preservation, and analysis of digital evidence, typically conducted after unauthorized access or misuse of a computer system has occurred. It involves applying analytical and investigative techniques to identify, collect, examine, and preserve magnetically stored or encoded information. The primary goal of cyber forensics is to find digital evidence to establish whether a fraud or crime has been committed. This field is critical because digital evidence is often present at crime scenes, necessitating that law enforcement and experts are able to recognize, seize, transport, and properly store it for forensic examination.

Key aspects and processes within computer forensics include:

- **Objectives**: Digital forensics aims to uncover and document evidence and leads, corroborate other discovered evidence, help in identifying patterns of events (often using data mining), connect attacker and victim computers (in line with Locard's Exchange Principle), reveal the end-to-end sequence of events leading to a compromise, and extract data that may be hidden, deleted, or not directly accessible.
- **Challenges**: Investigators face challenges due to miniaturized storage devices and the massive volume of digital data, making it difficult to find relevant forensic information, much like searching for a "needle in a haystack". Specialized forensic software is used to help filter relevant data from the larger, irrelevant mass.
- **Phases**: The digital forensic life cycle comprises several distinct phases: preparation and identification, collection and recording, storing and transporting, examination/investigation, analysis, interpretation and attribution, reporting, and testifying.
- **Evidence Rules**: For digital evidence to be admissible in court, it must adhere to cardinal rules, meaning it must be admissible, authentic, complete, reliable, understandable, and believable. During the collection phase, strict precautions, such as ensuring data is not altered, maintaining a detailed audit trail, and adhering to a clear chain of custody, are essential.

Steganography is a technique referred to as "sheltered writing" where the primary goal is to conceal the very existence of a message or communication. This differs from cryptography, which hides the content of a message but not its presence. The term "steganography" derives from Greek words meaning "hidden" (kryptos) and "to write" (graphein), thus "concealed writing". Methods used in steganography include embedding messages in microdots, merging text with images, or other techniques to hide information during storage or transmission, ensuring only the intended recipient is aware of and can access the hidden data. A common example involves manipulating the least significant bit of words within an image to embed a secret message. It can also be employed to create digital watermarks for copyright protection.

The relationship between computer forensics and steganography is direct and crucial. Since steganography is employed to hide data, often by malicious actors, detecting and extracting such hidden information becomes a vital task for computer forensic investigators. Digital forensics explicitly includes the objective of extracting data that might be hidden or not readily available. For instance, within the scope of digital forensics, image analysis specifically involves examining images for any evidence of steganography. This is particularly relevant in cases where individuals, such as terrorists, use steganographic techniques to conceal their communications within seemingly innocuous images shared online, making forensic analysis indispensable for uncovering such hidden messages. Forensic experts require specialized tools and methodologies to effectively detect and recover information hidden through steganography.

### Rootkits

The term **rootkit** is used to describe the mechanisms and techniques whereby malware—including viruses, spyware, and Trojans—attempt to hide their presence from spyware blockers, antivirus programs, and system management utilities. Rootkits can be classified as:

- **Persistent rootkits**
- **Memory-based rootkits**
- **User-mode rootkits**
- **Kernel-mode rootkits**

These classifications are based on whether the malware survives a reboot and whether it executes in **user mode** or **kernel mode**.

Basically, a rootkit is a **set of tools** used after compromising a computer operating system. These tools hide logins, processes, passwords, etc., in a way that carefully avoids detection by normal system monitoring commands. Rootkits are installed **after** an attacker has exploited a system vulnerability and gained **root access**. Rootkits themselves **do not** provide root access; they are used **after** a successful compromise.

Rootkits generally serve **three primary functions**:

1. **Maintain root access to the system**  
   The first and primary function of a rootkit is to maintain access to the compromised system. This access can be maintained through various communication channels—from an easily detectable Telnet shell to a secure shell or even covert channels overlaid on commonly used protocols. If an attacker cannot maintain access, they cannot exert control over the host.

2. **Hide the presence of the attacker**  
   The second main function of a rootkit is to hide or obfuscate the presence of the attacker. This is critical for success, as it helps the attacker maintain root access over time. Methods include:
   - Removing evidence of the compromise (e.g., cleaning log files)
   - Disabling monitoring daemons temporarily
   - Misrepresenting system state to administrators

   Hiding techniques can include:
   - Replacing system executables
   - Re-routing system calls
   - Installing a loadable kernel module

   Attackers often employ multiple hiding strategies to ensure stealth, applying the principle of **"offense in depth"**.

3. **Perform actions to meet the attacker's objectives**  
   The third function of a rootkit is to perform tasks that further the attacker's goals, such as:
   - Attacking other systems
   - Using keyloggers to capture sensitive information
   - Gathering packet traces from the local network
   - Performing vulnerability scans
   - Launching automated attacks from the compromised host

## **Relevance of the OSI  7 Layer Model to Computer Forensics**

![](https://talent500.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2025/02/What-is-OSI-Model.jpg)

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) 7-Layer Model holds significant relevance for computer forensics, particularly in the domain of network analysis. This model provides a structured framework for understanding how data travels across a communications network.

The **OSI 7 Layer Model** is useful from a computer forensics perspective because it addresses network protocols and communication processes. A basic familiarity with the OSI Model is assumed here. For more on the OSI Model and network protocols..

![](images/3.4.png)

The **OSI Model** (see Fig. 7.20) shows the Internet Protocols involved at each of the seven layers. Forensic analysts must understand how **TCP/IP** works. To effectively perform network forensics, professionals must have a strong understanding of network processes and protocols. Explaining these in detail is beyond the scope of this chapter; readers may refer to relevant chapters listed in Ref. #15.

In ** 1**, it was stated that "hacking" involves unauthorized access to computer systems. Effective **penetration testing** requires a deep understanding of hacker methods and motivations. The following subsections describe the typical steps taken by network attackers (refer to Fig. 7.21).

---

### Step 1: Foot Printing

**Foot printing** involves tools and techniques to create a profile of an organization’s security posture, such as:

- Domain names  
- IP addresses  
- Network blocks

**Tools used**:
- SamSpade
- `nslookup`
- `traceroute`
- `neotrace`

See **Tables 2.1 and 2.2** in Chapter 2 for more tools used during the “active attack” phase.

Once the attacker knows the IP addresses and domain names, they may perform scans such as:

- Ping sweeps  
- TCP/UDP port scans  
- OS fingerprinting

These tasks can be performed using **Nmap**, a free security scanner created by **Fyodor**.

Another important tool is **Metasploit** (see Table 4.1, Chapter 4), which automates:

- Penetration testing
- OS/application-based exploits

Performing exploits has become as easy as entering a target’s IP and clicking a button.

###  Step 2: Scanning and Probing

Hackers send:

- **Ping echo requests** to IP addresses to find live hosts.
- **TCP SYN requests** to ports to identify open services.

Using tools like **Nmap**, hackers determine:

- Device types  
- Operating systems  

This helps identify the easiest path to exploit.

**Script kiddies** (refer to Chapter 10) once used published scripts. Today, **click kiddies** use GUI tools to hack systems effortlessly (see Fig. 7.22).

![](images/3.5.png)

### Step 3: Gaining Access

The hacker’s goal is to gain access to systems to:

- Steal credit card data  
- Download confidential files  
- Manipulate critical data  

The information gathered during scanning aids in identifying weak points to exploit and gain access to the system.

### Step 4: Privilege Escalation

Initial access is limited to the exploited process’s privileges. Hackers aim to gain **root** or **administrator** access.

- If the compromised application runs under root, the hacker gets root access directly.
- If not, they may attempt **password cracking** or other privilege escalation techniques.

### Step 5: Exploit

With **root access**, the hacker has full control.

Motivations vary:

- **Fun/challenge** – Deface websites, leave “calling cards”
- **Financial gain** – Steal/sell information
- **Revenge** – Sabotage systems (e.g., disgruntled employees)

(See Fig. 7.21 for attacker motivations.)

### Step 6: Retracting / Covering Tracks

To avoid detection, hackers:

- Modify or delete system logs
- Mislead forensic investigators

### Step 7: Installing Backdoors

Hackers often install **backdoors** to retain future access. A backdoor:

- Is a hidden entry point into the system
- Is usually detectable by skilled security professionals

All hacker actions can be detected by a forensics investigator—if they know where to look.

### Practical Relevance of OSI Layers in Security

Professionals often use terms like “**Layer 3**,” “**Layer 2**,” or “**Application Layer**”—these refer to **OSI Model** layers.

- These concepts are fundamental to **network design**, **troubleshooting**, and **protocol development**.
- Applying the OSI Model helps **assess and address** network security threats.

Understanding and applying the OSI Model enhances:

- **Security assessments**
- **Forensic investigations**
- **Analysis of real-world threats**

###  Obfuscated IP Addresses and Spam

Cyberforensics experts have the skills to decode **obfuscated IP addresses**, often used by:

- Spammers
- Malicious actors

They hide their identity using:

- **Fake email addresses**
- **Obfuscated URLs**

Example:  
A human-readable IP (e.g., `135.17.243.191`) may appear in **10-digit integer** (base-256) format like: "http://2280853951"

## **Challenges in Computer Forensics**

Computer forensics faces several significant challenges, which investigators must navigate to successfully identify, acquire, preserve, and analyze digital evidence. These challenges span technical, logistical, and legal domains:

- **Miniaturization and Volume of Digital Data**
    - One primary challenge stems from the ever-growing volume and miniaturization of storage devices. This makes the task of finding relevant digital forensic evidence akin to searching for a "needle in a haystack". For instance, a 500 GB hard disk, if printed on A4 paper, would result in 500,000 inches of paper, making it virtually impossible to manually retrieve relevant forensic data without specialized software that helps sieve relevant data from the irrelevant mass.
- **Data Volatility and Manipulation**
    - Digital evidence is inherently volatile and can be easily changed or manipulated. Once altered, it is usually impossible to detect that a change has taken place unless specific precautions, such as calculating a cryptographic hash of the evidence file, were taken at the time of collection. This necessitates extreme care during the handling of computer evidence to maintain its integrity.
- **Hidden, Deleted, or Encrypted Data**
    - Forensic experts routinely encounter complexities such as data that has been hidden, deleted, altered, or encrypted. Extracting such data is a key objective of digital forensics, but it presents a considerable technical hurdle.
- **Difficulty in Analysis, Interpretation, and Attribution**
    - Analyzing, interpreting, and attributing evidence are considered among the "most difficult aspects" for most forensic analysts. While there might be a finite number of possible event sequences, the actual number can be unfathomably large, impacting the process of drawing conclusions from digital evidence.
- **Adherence to Legal Rules of Evidence**
    - For digital evidence to be admissible in court, it must comply with cardinal rules: it must be admissible, authentic, complete, reliable, understandable, and believable. This legal requirement poses challenges, particularly in ensuring that data is not altered, maintaining a detailed audit trail, and adhering to a clear chain of custody from the moment of collection to its presentation in court. If the chain of custody is broken due to discrepancies, the evidence may be declared inadmissible.
- **Need for Special Expertise**
    - Handling digital evidence demands specialized expertise gained through extensive training and experience. Forensic experts are needed to navigate the technological complexities, including the proliferation of various operating systems and file systems, each requiring specific forensic tools and interpretation skills.
- **Technical Challenges with Raw Data Structure**
    - Understanding the raw data and its underlying structure presents its own technical challenges.
- **Legal Challenges and Data Privacy Issues**
    - Computer forensics also faces legal challenges related to data privacy issues.
- **Logistical and Practical Limitations**
    - Investigations can be constrained by practical limitations such as budgetary constraints, strict time deadlines, and varying levels of cooperation from adverse parties. This also includes considerations for required travel and the logistics of on-site or after-hours forensic imaging.

### ** Special Technique: Data Mining in Cyberforensics**

Data mining is a broad field, but in this section, we focus only on how it's used in **cyberforensics**—the practice of investigating and analyzing digital data to solve cybercrimes.

#### **Purpose in Cyberforensics**

Cybercrimes range from minor infractions to serious global incidents like terrorism. Law enforcement agencies collect and analyze digital crime data to detect trends, identify suspects, and prevent future crimes. Depending on the crime, the impact may be on:

- **National security**
    
- **Financial institutions**
    
- **Individuals**
    
- **Businesses and their reputations**
    

#### **Traditional Data Mining Techniques**

These methods help analyze **structured data** (organized data like tables):

- **Association analysis** – finds relationships between events/items.
    
- **Classification and prediction** – assigns categories or forecasts outcomes.
    
- **Cluster analysis** – groups similar data items.
    
- **Outlier analysis** – identifies unusual patterns or anomalies.
    


Modern methods also handle **unstructured data** (like emails, images, and texts). However, they raise **privacy concerns**, especially when used by law enforcement or national security agencies.

### **Key Data Mining Techniques in Cyberforensics**

#### **1. Entity Extraction**

- Identifies key information (names, addresses, vehicles, etc.) from **text, images, or audio**.
    
- In cyberforensics, it's used to extract:
    
    - Program structures
        
    - Code patterns
        
    - Hacker behavior
        
- Helps group similar software and trace malicious sources.
    
- **Limitation**: Requires **clean and large data sets** to work effectively.
    

#### **2. Clustering Techniques**

- Groups similar data items (e.g., suspects using similar methods or gangs).
    
- **No predefined categories**—the system identifies patterns on its own.
    
- Example: Linking people, organizations, or vehicles from crime reports.
    
- Used by systems like **FinCEN AI** to detect:
    
    - Money laundering
        
    - Suspicious financial transactions
        
- **Limitation**: Requires heavy computational power.
    

#### **3. Association Rule Mining**

- Finds frequent patterns in data (e.g., items often occurring together).
    
- Used to:
    
    - Detect **network intrusions**
        
    - Analyze **user behavior**
        
    - Profile **network attackers**
        
    - Predict future cyberattacks
        
- Converts user interaction data into actionable insights for cyber defense.
    

### **Need for a Unified Framework**

To improve effectiveness, investigators need:

- A **framework** that connects the **type of cybercrime** with the **right analysis technique**.
    
- Understanding how different tools apply to different crimes helps:
    
    - Spot trends
        
    - Address emerging threats
        
    - Predict criminal behavior
