## **Computer Forensics and Steganography**

Computer forensics is a specialized field focused on the systematic identification, acquisition, preservation, and analysis of digital evidence, typically conducted after unauthorized access or misuse of a computer system has occurred. It involves applying analytical and investigative techniques to identify, collect, examine, and preserve magnetically stored or encoded information. The primary goal of cyber forensics is to find digital evidence to establish whether a fraud or crime has been committed. This field is critical because digital evidence is often present at crime scenes, necessitating that law enforcement and experts are able to recognize, seize, transport, and properly store it for forensic examination.

Key aspects and processes within computer forensics include:

- **Objectives**: Digital forensics aims to uncover and document evidence and leads, corroborate other discovered evidence, help in identifying patterns of events (often using data mining), connect attacker and victim computers (in line with Locard's Exchange Principle), reveal the end-to-end sequence of events leading to a compromise, and extract data that may be hidden, deleted, or not directly accessible.
- **Challenges**: Investigators face challenges due to miniaturized storage devices and the massive volume of digital data, making it difficult to find relevant forensic information, much like searching for a "needle in a haystack". Specialized forensic software is used to help filter relevant data from the larger, irrelevant mass.
- **Phases**: The digital forensic life cycle comprises several distinct phases: preparation and identification, collection and recording, storing and transporting, examination/investigation, analysis, interpretation and attribution, reporting, and testifying.
- **Evidence Rules**: For digital evidence to be admissible in court, it must adhere to cardinal rules, meaning it must be admissible, authentic, complete, reliable, understandable, and believable. During the collection phase, strict precautions, such as ensuring data is not altered, maintaining a detailed audit trail, and adhering to a clear chain of custody, are essential.

Steganography is a technique referred to as "sheltered writing" where the primary goal is to conceal the very existence of a message or communication. This differs from cryptography, which hides the content of a message but not its presence. The term "steganography" derives from Greek words meaning "hidden" (kryptos) and "to write" (graphein), thus "concealed writing". Methods used in steganography include embedding messages in microdots, merging text with images, or other techniques to hide information during storage or transmission, ensuring only the intended recipient is aware of and can access the hidden data. A common example involves manipulating the least significant bit of words within an image to embed a secret message. It can also be employed to create digital watermarks for copyright protection.

The relationship between computer forensics and steganography is direct and crucial. Since steganography is employed to hide data, often by malicious actors, detecting and extracting such hidden information becomes a vital task for computer forensic investigators. Digital forensics explicitly includes the objective of extracting data that might be hidden or not readily available. For instance, within the scope of digital forensics, image analysis specifically involves examining images for any evidence of steganography. This is particularly relevant in cases where individuals, such as terrorists, use steganographic techniques to conceal their communications within seemingly innocuous images shared online, making forensic analysis indispensable for uncovering such hidden messages. Forensic experts require specialized tools and methodologies to effectively detect and recover information hidden through steganography.

## Rootkits 

The term rootkit is used to describe the mechanisms and techniques whereby malware including viruses, Spyware and Trojans attempt to hide their presence from Spyware blockers, antivirus and system management utilities. Rootkits can be classified as — persistent rootkits, memory-based rootkits, user-mode rootkits and kernel-mode rootkits. These classifications are made depending on whether the malware survives reboot and whether it executes in user mode or kernel mode, Basically, a “rootkit” is a set of tools used after cracking a computer operating system that hides logins, processes, password, etc., which would carefully hide any trace that those commands normally display. Rootkits are installed after an attacker has exploited a system vulnerability and gained root access. Rootkits by themselves do not give an attacker’ root access; they only work after a system compromise. Rootkits consist of tools that generally have three functions: (a) maintain root access to the system, (b) hide the presence of the attacker and (c) attack (or accelerate attacks) against other systems. From attacker's perspective, rootkits serve following important functions: I. The first, and primary, function of a rootkit is to maintain access to the compromised system. This access can happen via any communication channel from an easily detectable telnet shell to a secure shell to covert communication channels overlaid over commonly used protocols, An attacker who cannot maintain access to a host cannot exert his or her control over it. 2. ‘The second main function of a rootkit is to hide, or otherwise obfuscate, the presence of the attacker. The ability to hide the presence of an attacker is what makes the rootkit such a powerful tool and is critical to the success of an attacker in maintaining root access to a system. This is achieved by removing evidence of the compromise and taking measures to misrepresent the system state to curious or confused system administrators, Removing evidence can be achieved through cleaning various log files and temporarily disabling any monitoring demons. How a rootkit chooses to hide its presence and the presence of the attacker is the qualifying characteristic of the rootkit. For example, an attacker could replace commonly used system executables, re-route system calls and install a loadable kernel module in a single rootkit installation. Attackers typically choose more than one method of hiding their presence (like for “defense in depth” think “offense in depth”!). 3. ‘The third function of a rootkit is to perform actions that meet the attacker's objectives, mainly by attacking or aiding in attacking other systems. This usually means compromising host security (e.g., by using keyloggers), gathering packet traces on the local network, performing vulnerability scans or even launching automated attacks from the compromised host,

## **Relevance of the OSI  7 Layer Model to Computer Forensics**

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) 7-Layer Model holds significant relevance for computer forensics, particularly in the domain of network analysis. This model provides a structured framework for understanding how data travels across a communications network.
