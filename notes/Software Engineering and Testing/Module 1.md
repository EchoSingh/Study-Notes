1. Define Software Engineering.

  Software engineering is an engineering discipline concerned with all aspects of software production, from the initial concept and system specification through to operation and maintenance. It involves applying theories, methods, and tools selectively while working within organizational and financial constraints to find solutions.

Key aspects of software engineering include:

- **Purpose**: Its primary purpose is to produce reliable and trustworthy systems economically and quickly. It supports professional software development, which involves teams rather than individuals, and software that is maintained and changed throughout its life.
- **Scope**: It is not just about the technical processes of software development but also includes activities such as software project management and the development of supporting tools, methods, and theories.
- **Systematic Approach**: Software engineers generally adopt a systematic and organized approach, although a more creative, less formal approach might be suitable for certain types of software, such as interactive web-based systems and mobile apps.
- **Distinction from Programming**: It encompasses techniques for program specification, design, and evolution, which are typically not relevant for personal software development. It's fundamentally about managing the complexities of building large and evolving software systems.
- **Interdisciplinary Nature**: Software engineering is related to both computer science and systems engineering.
    - **Computer Science**: Focuses on the theories and methods underlying computers and software systems, whereas software engineering addresses the practical problems of producing software.
    - **Systems Engineering**: Is a broader field concerned with all aspects of developing and evolving complex systems where software plays a major role, including hardware development, policy and process design, and system deployment. Software engineering is a part of this more general process.

The discipline emerged in 1968 in response to the "software crisis," where individual programming approaches did not scale effectively for large and complex systems, leading to unreliability, cost overruns, and late deliveries.

with block diagrams.

Systems engineering is an engineering discipline focused on the comprehensive design and evolution of entire complex systems where software plays a significant role. It addresses all aspects of computer-based systems development, encompassing hardware, software, and process engineering. Systems engineers are tasked with specifying the system, defining its overarching architecture, and integrating diverse parts to create the finished product. This includes considering the capabilities of hardware and software, as well as the system's interactions with human users and its environment. It's a broad field that spans procuring, specifying, developing, deploying, operating, and maintaining both technical and sociotechnical systems.

The lifetime of large, complex systems is typically structured into four overlapping stages, as illustrated by a general process model:

Below are the principal stages of systems engineering:

1. **Conceptual Design** This is the initial systems engineering activity where the concept of the required system is developed. It involves investigating the idea's feasibility and formulating an overall vision for the system. The purpose of the system, its necessity, and the high-level features users might expect are defined in non-technical language. This stage also identifies broad constraints, such as the need for interoperability with other systems. The outcome of this phase is typically a system vision document, which is used to inform users about the system and serves as a basis for defining tender documents and refining system requirements.
    
2. **Procurement (or Acquisition)** During this stage, the conceptual design is further refined to provide information for decisions regarding the system development contract. This includes determining how functionality will be distributed across hardware, software, and operational processes. Decisions are also made on which hardware and software to acquire, which suppliers will develop the system, and the terms and conditions of the supply contract. This process aims to decide what system to buy and who should supply it. Procurement may occur multiple times, extending into the development and operation phases, especially as new equipment and software become available.
    
3. **Development** This stage involves the actual development or purchase of system elements and their integration to create the final system. The system requirements, refined from the conceptual design, act as the bridge to this process. Development processes typically include detailed requirements definition, system design, hardware and software engineering, system integration, and testing. During this phase, operational processes are defined, and training courses for system users are designed. System development processes usually follow a plan-driven, "waterfall" model because different system elements are independently developed by various contractors, necessitating early interface design and comprehensive understanding of requirements before hardware development. Sub-activities within development include requirements engineering, architectural design, requirements partitioning, subsystem engineering, system integration, system testing, and system deployment.
    
4. **Operation** In this final stage, the system is deployed, users are trained, and the system is put into practical use. Operational processes, as defined during development, often need to change to reflect the real working environment where the system is used. The system continuously evolves as new requirements are identified and implemented. This evolution may involve further development and additional hardware/software procurement. Eventually, the system's value may decline, leading to its decommissioning and replacement.
    
These stages are not strictly sequential but overlap and involve continuous feedback, with changes and updates occurring throughout the system's lifetime.
