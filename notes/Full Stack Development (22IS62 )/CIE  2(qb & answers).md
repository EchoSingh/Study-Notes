4. Explain the importance of Model View Control (MVC) in Web Development. Describe a very popularly used MVC framework.

5. Given an array of objects, where each object represents a student with properties like USN No, Name (string) and Grade (number).  Develop a JavaScript function `rangeOfStudents` that takes this array and returns a new array containing count of students who have a grade in ranges:  0–20, 21–30, 31–40, 41–50.
 
   ```javascript
   const students = [
      { usnno: "1BS23023", name: "swachha", grade: 45 },
      { usnno: "1BS23028", name: "garathi", grade: 36 },
      { usnno: "1BS23024", name: "racket", grade: 42 },
      { usnno: "1BS23025", name: "savya", grade: 35 },
      { usnno: "1BS23026", name: "pacchi", grade: 25 },
      { usnno: "1BS23029", name: "gathi", grade: 22 },
      { usnno: "1BS23030", name: "vidhi", grade: 20 },
   ];
   ````

 6. Illustrate with distinct code examples how you would use at least three different types of jQuery selectors to target and identify specific HTML elements within a web page. For each example, clearly describe which elements would be selected.

7. Demonstrate your understanding of Array Destructuring, Object Destructuring, and Parameter Destructuring in JavaScript by writing three distinct code snippets.

8. Write a JS code snippet to explain how Arrays are created. Explain the purpose of the Array along with its different types of representation.

9. Discuss the importance of JS Prototype and Prototype Inheritance in web design. Provide examples of commonly used properties.

10. Create an HTML document for a blog post. The document should include:

    - Control Flow
    
    - Variable Declaration
    

 11. Write a JavaScript to print numbers 1 to 100 in an array.

    - If number is divisible by 3, print `Bizz`
    
    - If divisible by 5, print `Fizz`
    
     - If divisible by both, print `BizzFizz`
    

12. Describe Arrow Functions, Hoisting, and Callback Functions in detail.

13. Create an HTML document for a blog post. The document should include:

     - JS Functions
    
     - Callback Functions
    

14. Analyse the Components of Back-End Development in JS and elaborate the need and usage of each component.

15. Analyse the concept of DOM Manipulation and elaborate on how DOM tree is constructed along with its Nodes.

 16. Name and explain, in your own words, the key difference between how primitive and non-primitive data types are represented in JavaScript.
 17. Describe the purpose and demonstrate with distinct examples how the string operations `lastIndexOf()`, `slice()`, and `substring()` can be used to extract or locate specific parts of a given text. Explain the key differences in their behaviour and output.

18. Develop a JavaScript program to check if a given number is an Armstrong number (sum of cubes is equal to the given number) or not.

19. Describe use of the spread operator in arrays and objects with an example.

20. Design a modular JavaScript function `validateRegistration` that takes an object containing `username`, `password`, `confirmPassword`, and `email` as input properties. This function should:
     -  Analyse the provided input to determine if each field meets the following criteria:
    
         - **Username**: Not empty
        
        - **Password**: At least 6 characters long
        
        - **Confirm Password**: Matches the password field
        
    - Categorize any validation failures for each field
