    - In construction, wireless terminals with **GPS (Global Positioning Systems)** can provide accurate location information for equipment like bulldozers and earth graders, guiding operators.
    - Wireless technology is crucial for warehouse operations, enabling managers to use warehouse management systems (WMS) to **track activities from receiving to shipping** and access current stock statistics.
    - Industrial plants utilize **wireless remote sensors (motes)** to collect and transmit data to a central location, allowing technicians to monitor machine status and take corrective measures.
- **Education Sector**:
    - Many university and college campuses are equipped with **Wi-Fi technology**, allowing instructors and students to access the campus network wirelessly from almost any location, including hostels and cafeterias.
    - This enables instructors to create presentations on notebooks and use them in classrooms without physical connections, and allows teachers to **distribute handouts directly to students' wireless devices**. It also reduces the need for expensive wired infrastructure in classrooms and labs.
- **Health Services**:
    - Hospitals use **VoIP (Voice over IP) over hospital WLANs** to improve communication among doctors and nurses, eliminating the need for public address paging.
    - Notebooks on mobile carts or handheld PDAs with bar code scanners or **RFID tags and wireless connections** enable immediate documentation of patient medication administration, improving accuracy and efficiency.
- **Government and Military Operations**:
    - Government offices deploy **broadband wireless networks** for employees and contractors at remote construction sites to access central databases.
    - Police officers can **download and upload streaming video** to aid in tackling road accidents and crime.
    - Military personnel utilize cellular and satellite communications for **talking, internet access, and receiving full-motion video** through wireless handsets, and can connect with other wireless devices using Bluetooth or WLAN for defense applications.
- **Event and Travel Management**:
    - Large public auditoriums and stadiums use wireless systems to facilitate **ticket distribution and event control**. Entry tickets with unique **RFID tags** are scanned at entry points for instant validation, preventing counterfeit or stolen tickets.
    - Wireless transmissions provide in-progress game statistics to attendees with wireless devices.
    - The travel industry uses wireless **GPS (Global Positioning Systems)** for emergency roadside assistance and airport terminals transmit wireless signals for passengers to access the internet or email while waiting for flights. Airplanes are also being equipped with **wireless Internet capabilities for passengers**.
- **Machine-to-Machine (M2M) Communications**:
    - Wireless communication devices are integrated into equipment for **telemetry applications**, such as automatically sending data and voice messages to control centers via cellular radio networks.
    - Examples include integration in automobiles, fleet management systems, fire and security alarms, vending machines, and public utility meters.
    - Wireless devices will increasingly be built into domestic appliances and industrial machinery, automating existing functions like **remote metering for gas, electricity, and water consumption**.
    - Vehicles are being developed to automatically call for help after an accident and provide precise location and incident information.

2. **What are the functional requirements of evolution of next-generation networks?**

The evolution of next-generation wireless networks is driven by the increasing demand for enhanced communication capabilities, moving beyond traditional voice services to encompass comprehensive multimedia experiences. The functional requirements for these networks include:

- **Very High-Speed and High-Quality Transmission**
    
    - Next-generation mobile communication systems are required to handle a large volume of multimedia information, such as downloading full songs, complete data files, or video clips.
    - This is achieved by supporting **data transmission at speeds between 50 Mbps and 100 Mbps**, with **asymmetric data speeds** in uplink and downlink directions.
    - LTE, as part of this evolution, provides speeds up to **100 Mbps for downlink and 50 Mbps for uplink** under ideal conditions, enabling applications like HD video streaming, online gaming, cloud applications, and video conferencing.
    - These systems also demand **continuous coverage** over large geographical areas.
    - **Lower latency** is crucial, with LTE reducing it to approximately **10 ms** (compared to ~100 ms in 3G), which is vital for real-time applications such as VoIP calls, online multiplayer games, industrial automation, and IoT.
    - Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms, including efficient encoding, error detection and correction techniques, echo cancellers, and voice equalizers, are applied at low, affordable operating costs to ensure high quality.
- **Open Platform**
    
    - Next-generation mobile communication systems should be "open" across various components: mobile phone platforms, service nodes, and mobile network mechanisms.
    - This openness allows users the freedom to **select protocols, applications, and networks**.
    - Advanced service and content providers can extend their offerings independently of network operators.
    - Furthermore, location and charging information should be shareable among different networks and applications.
- **Flexible and Varied Service Functions**
    
    - Next-generation networks aim for **seamless integration across diverse mediums**, including wireless, optical fiber, satellite, and wireline.
    - They require **interconnectivity with existing networks** like GSM or CDMA.
    - Third-generation (3G) systems, a precursor to next-generation networks, were designed to combine **telephony, Internet, and multimedia into a single device**. They are based on a packet-switched network backbone and support Internet protocols.
    - IMT-2000, as a 3G standard, aims to offer flexible data rates up to **2 Mbps** for mobile users, including 144 kbps for high-speed vehicles, 384 kbps for slow-moving pedestrians, and 2 Mbps for office use.
    - These networks support both **symmetrical and asymmetrical data transmission rates**, as well as both **circuit-switched and packet-switched data services**.
    - Service classes include traditional voice (comparable to PSTN quality), switched data (dial-up, fax, basic Internet), and advanced messaging (full text, graphics, video).
- **Seamless Mobility**
    
    - A primary objective of next-generation wireless networks is to provide users with **ubiquitous access to information anywhere, anytime**, with a seamless connection to a wide range of services, including large volumes of data, images, and video.
    - This demands **seamless connectivity** between a wide variety of mobile devices and access technologies, such as Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) and Wireless Wide Area Networks (WWANs).
    - Roaming and communication between these diverse technologies are essential to achieving seamless mobility.
    - The evolution requires a **seamless migration path** from existing digital wireless networks, ensuring inter-working capabilities.
    - Next-generation networks will feature broader bandwidth, higher data rates, and **smoother and quicker hand-offs** to ensure continuous service across various wireless systems. This includes the capability for seamless hand-offs in homogeneous networks (e.g., IEEE 802.11 WLAN and cellular) at the MAC layer.
