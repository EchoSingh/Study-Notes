2. **What are the functional requirements of evolution of next-generation networks?**

The evolution of next-generation wireless networks is driven by the increasing demand for enhanced communication capabilities, moving beyond traditional voice services to encompass comprehensive multimedia experiences. The functional requirements for these networks include:

- **Very High-Speed and High-Quality Transmission**
    
    - Next-generation mobile communication systems are required to handle a large volume of multimedia information, such as downloading full songs, complete data files, or video clips.
    - This is achieved by supporting **data transmission at speeds between 50 Mbps and 100 Mbps**, with **asymmetric data speeds** in uplink and downlink directions.
    - LTE, as part of this evolution, provides speeds up to **100 Mbps for downlink and 50 Mbps for uplink** under ideal conditions, enabling applications like HD video streaming, online gaming, cloud applications, and video conferencing.
    - These systems also demand **continuous coverage** over large geographical areas.
    - **Lower latency** is crucial, with LTE reducing it to approximately **10 ms** (compared to ~100 ms in 3G), which is vital for real-time applications such as VoIP calls, online multiplayer games, industrial automation, and IoT.
    - Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms, including efficient encoding, error detection and correction techniques, echo cancellers, and voice equalizers, are applied at low, affordable operating costs to ensure high quality.
- **Open Platform**
    
    - Next-generation mobile communication systems should be "open" across various components: mobile phone platforms, service nodes, and mobile network mechanisms.
    - This openness allows users the freedom to **select protocols, applications, and networks**.
    - Advanced service and content providers can extend their offerings independently of network operators.
    - Furthermore, location and charging information should be shareable among different networks and applications.
- **Flexible and Varied Service Functions**
    
    - Next-generation networks aim for **seamless integration across diverse mediums**, including wireless, optical fiber, satellite, and wireline.
    - They require **interconnectivity with existing networks** like GSM or CDMA.
    - Third-generation (3G) systems, a precursor to next-generation networks, were designed to combine **telephony, Internet, and multimedia into a single device**. They are based on a packet-switched network backbone and support Internet protocols.
    - IMT-2000, as a 3G standard, aims to offer flexible data rates up to **2 Mbps** for mobile users, including 144 kbps for high-speed vehicles, 384 kbps for slow-moving pedestrians, and 2 Mbps for office use.
    - These networks support both **symmetrical and asymmetrical data transmission rates**, as well as both **circuit-switched and packet-switched data services**.
    - Service classes include traditional voice (comparable to PSTN quality), switched data (dial-up, fax, basic Internet), and advanced messaging (full text, graphics, video).
- **Seamless Mobility**
    
    - A primary objective of next-generation wireless networks is to provide users with **ubiquitous access to information anywhere, anytime**, with a seamless connection to a wide range of services, including large volumes of data, images, and video.
    - This demands **seamless connectivity** between a wide variety of mobile devices and access technologies, such as Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) and Wireless Wide Area Networks (WWANs).
    - Roaming and communication between these diverse technologies are essential to achieving seamless mobility.
    - The evolution requires a **seamless migration path** from existing digital wireless networks, ensuring inter-working capabilities.
    - Next-generation networks will feature broader bandwidth, higher data rates, and **smoother and quicker hand-offs** to ensure continuous service across various wireless systems. This includes the capability for seamless hand-offs in homogeneous networks (e.g., IEEE 802.11 WLAN and cellular) at the MAC layer.

3. **Compare the different wireless communication modes (Simplex, Half-Duplex, and Full-Duplex).**

Wireless communication systems can be broadly categorized into three distinct modes based on their transmission capabilities: Simplex, Half-Duplex, and Full-Duplex.

Here's a comparison of these modes:

- **Simplex Wireless Systems**
    
    - **Direction of Communication**: Communication is possible in **only one direction** from the transmitter to the receiver at any given time.
    - **Frequency Usage**: Separate transmitters and receivers operate at the **same frequency**.
    - **Acknowledgement**: Received messages are **not acknowledged**.
    - **Examples**: Paging and messaging systems, where fixed paging transmitters send short text or alphanumeric messages to pagers.
- **Half-Duplex Wireless Systems**
    
    - **Direction of Communication**: Allow **two-way communication**, but a subscriber can **only transmit or receive** voice information at any given time, not simultaneously.
    - **Frequency Usage**: The **same frequency** is used for both transmission and reception.
    - **Control Mechanism**: Typically use a **"push-to-talk"** feature to enable transmission.
    - **Examples**: Walkie-talkie sets used by police and paramilitary forces.
- **Full-Duplex Wireless Systems**
    
    - **Direction of Communication**: Allow **simultaneous radio transmission and reception** between the calling and called subscribers of the system, either directly or via a base station. Mobile communication systems are predominantly full-duplex.
    - **Methods for Simultaneous Communication**:
        - **Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD)**: Uses **separate frequency channels** for communication to and from the subscriber.
            - At the base station, separate transmit and receive antennas are used to accommodate the forward (base station to mobile) and reverse (mobile to base station) frequency channels.
            - In the subscriber unit (e.g., mobile phone), a device called a **duplexer** is used to enable the same antenna for simultaneous transmission and reception.
            - Examples include the US AMPS standard and European GSM cellular standards, which define a specific radio channel using a pair of simplex RF channels with a fixed frequency separation (e.g., 45 MHz in AMPS).
        - **Time Division Duplexing (TDD)**: Uses **different time slots on a single radio channel** for communication.
            - A portion of the time is allocated for data transfer from the base station to the mobile subscriber, and the remaining time is used for data transfer from the mobile subscriber to the base station on the _same frequency channel_.
    - **Examples**: Standard telephone voice communication and cellular mobile communication systems.
