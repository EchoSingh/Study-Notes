5. **Briefly explain Radar Communication and Satellite Communication.**

 Here's a brief explanation of Radar Communication and Satellite Communication, drawing on the provided sources:

**Radar Communication** Radar Communication is an **active remote-sensing system that operates on the principle of echoes**. Its development traces back to the discoveries of electromagnetic waves by James Maxwell and Heinrich Hertz in the 1860s and 1870s. The first successful radio range-finding experiment occurred in 1924, with Edward Appleton using radio echoes to determine the height of the ionosphere. The **first practical radar system was produced in 1935 by British physicist Robert Watson-Watt**.

By 1939, England had established radar stations to detect aggressors. A radar display presents a **map-like picture of the scanned area**, with radar echoes shown as bright spots. Beyond detecting airplanes and ships, radar is used for **weather forecasting, scanning regions for archaeological sites, studying hidden dangers in tunnels, and locating stagnant water pools**. The term **RADAR** was coined in 1941 as an acronym for **RAdio Detection And Ranging**, originally being called Radio Direction Finder (RDF).

**Satellite Communication** A satellite is **any object that orbits or revolves around another object**, such as the Moon orbiting Earth. **Man-made satellites provide global communication capabilities**, transmitting services like television signals, telephone calls, faxes, computer communications, and weather information. The concept of satellites dates back to Sir Isaac Newton in the 1720s, who illustrated how an artificial satellite could be launched from Earth. In 1945, science-fiction author **Arthur C. Clarke envisioned a network of communication satellites**.

While countries typically own their earth-receiving stations, the **explosive popularity of cellular telephones drove the demand for constant global connectivity**. This led to companies providing solutions using **satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO), around 650 kilometers high**. For example, Motorola's Iridium project planned to launch 66 LEO satellites in 1998 to offer communication services to handheld phones worldwide. India's first satellite, **Aryabhatta**, built by ISRO, was launched by the Soviet Union on April 19, 1975, for astronomy experiments.

6. **Explain the transition from Analog to Digital Systems.**

  The transition from Analog to Digital Systems in wireless communication, particularly with the advent of GSM, was driven by several crucial factors:

- **System Capacity**: During the 1980s, cellular systems experienced significant growth. Analog systems were **unable to cope with this increasing demand**. To overcome this, new frequency bands were allocated, and new modulation and coding technologies were introduced. Digital radio emerged as the **best option to handle the capacity needs in a cost-efficient way**.
- **Quality Aspects**: Digital technology allowed for a **considerable improvement in the quality of service** compared to analog systems. Analog systems would transmit physical disturbances like fades, multipath reception, spurious signals, or interferences to the receiver, resulting in degraded communication quality through effects like fadeouts, crosstalks, and hisses. Digital systems, by **transforming the signal into bits** and employing techniques like digital coding, avoid these disturbances, leading to **improved transmission quality**, especially noticeable under difficult reception conditions.
- **Compatibility with Other Systems (such as ISDN)**: The decision to adopt digital technology for GSM was made as the telecommunications industry was already converting to digital methods, exemplified by the ISDN network. Digital systems provided **better compatibility with services offered by ISDN** and offered greater flexibility for **implementing future improvements and changes** to system characteristics.
- **Efficient Signal Utilization**: Analog systems inherently **do not fully utilize the signal** between the phone and the cellular network. This is because analog signals cannot be compressed and manipulated as easily as digital signals, which motivated many service providers to transition to digital systems.
