1. **Define GSM and mention its main features.**  

**GSM (Global System for Mobile communications)** is a **second-generation (2G) digital mobile cellular communication standard**. It was initiated by the **ETSI (European Telecommunications Standardisation Institute)** and is universally accepted. GSM utilizes **digital radio channeling** to provide audio, information, and multimedia communication systems. It operates as a mobile network that manages communication between mobile stations, base stations, and switching systems. The decision to adopt digital technology for GSM was made to ensure compatibility with systems like ISDN and to facilitate future improvements.

Here are its main features:

- **Network Architecture**
    
    - GSM consists of three major subsystems: the **Mobile Station (MS)**, the **Base Station Subsystem (BSS)**, and the **Network and Switching Subsystem (NSS)**.
    - An **Operation Subsystem (OSS)** is also part of the architecture, responsible for maintenance, subscription management (including charging and billing), and mobile equipment management.
    - Key interfaces include the **Um interface** (between MS and BTS), the **A-bis interface** (between BTS and BSC), and the **A interface** (between BSC and MSC).
- **Spectrum and Access Technology**
    
    - GSM uses **Frequency-Division Duplexing (FDD)**, with separate frequency bands for uplink (890-915 MHz) and downlink (935-960 MHz) transmissions, generally in the 900 MHz and 1.8 GHz bands in Europe and 850 MHz and 1.9 GHz bands in the US.
    - It employs a **combination of FDMA and TDMA** to provide multiple access to mobile users. Each 25 MHz band is divided into 124 RF channels, each **200 kHz wide**.
    - Each radio channel supports **8 time slots** for TDMA operation, allowing for a total of 1000 traffic channels (125 channels x 8 time slots, accounting for guard bands).
    - **Hybrid TDMA/FHMA** (Frequency Hopped Multiple Access) can also be optionally employed, which supports a frequency-hopping pattern of 217.6 hops per second, increasing system capacity and improving signal quality.
- **Modulation and Data Rates**
    
    - GSM uses **Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK)** for modulation, which offers high spectral and power efficiency with a constant amplitude envelope.
    - It supports voice calls and data transfer speeds of **up to 9.6 kbps**. The gross data rate of each carrier is 270.833 kbps.
- **SIM Card and User Identity**
    
    - A unique feature of GSM is the **Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card**, a smart card (typically 32 KB memory) that stores user-specific information such as the subscriber's identification number, privacy keys, and authorized cellular networks.
    - The **Mobile Equipment (ME)** is generic and requires a SIM card to function, meaning the SIM roams, not the mobile equipment. This allows users to easily swap devices by simply inserting their SIM card.
- **Security and Authentication**
    
    - GSM provides **on-the-air privacy** by encrypting the digital bit stream sent by a GSM transmitter, making eavesdropping virtually impossible.
    - Authentication is performed using a predefined protocol that compares the **International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI)**. A unique secret key stored on the SIM card is used in algorithms A3 and A8 for security purposes. PIN protection on the SIM card also provides security against fraudulent use.
- **Hand-off Mechanism**
    
    - GSM primarily uses a **hard hand-off** mechanism, where the connection with the current serving cell is broken before a new connection is established with another cell.
    - Hand-off procedures in GSM are typically initiated due to signal strength deterioration at the cell boundary.
- **Services and Features**
    
    - GSM services are broadly classified into **Teleservices**, **Bearer Services (Data Services)**, and **Supplementary ISDN Services**.
    - **Teleservices** include standard mobile telephony, emergency calls, and facsimile.
    - **Bearer Services** offer data transmission capabilities, supporting packet-switched protocols and data rates from 300 bps to approximately 9.6 kbps.
    - **Supplementary ISDN Services** are digital services like call diversion, caller identification, and **Short Message Service (SMS)**.
    - **SMS** is a core feature, allowing users to send and receive text messages up to 160 characters. SMS can be transmitted simultaneously with voice or data calls and operates as a store-and-forward service.
- **Evolution Path**
    
    - GSM serves as the foundation for **2.5G technologies** like **HSCSD (High Speed Circuit Switched Data)**, **GPRS (General Packet Radio Service)**, and **EDGE (Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution)**, which offer higher data transfer speeds and packet-switched data capabilities.
    - It also forms the basis for the **3G UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System)**, with **W-CDMA** as its air interface.
