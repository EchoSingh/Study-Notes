7. **Consider a single high-power transmitter that can support 40 voice channels over an area of 140 km² with the available spectrum.**  
   _If this area is equally divided into seven smaller areas (cells), each supported by lower power transmitters so that each cell supports 30% of the channels, then determine:_  
   - (a) **Coverage area of each cell**  
   - (b) **Total number of voice channels available in the cellular system**  
   _Comment on the results obtained._

8. **Calculate the number of times the cluster of size 4 has to be replicated in order to approximately cover the entire service area of 1765 km² with the adequate number of uniform-sized cells of 7 km² each.**

---

9. **A mobile communication system is allocated RF spectrum of 25 MHz and uses RF channel bandwidth of 25 kHz so that a total number of 1000 voice channels can be supported in the system.**  
   - (a) **If the service area is divided into 20 cells with a frequency reuse factor of 4, compute the system capacity.**  
   - (b) **The cell size is reduced so that the service area is now covered with 100 cells. Compute the system capacity while keeping the frequency reuse factor as 4.**  
   - (c) **The cell size is further reduced so the same service area is now covered with 700 cells and the frequency reuse factor is 7. Compute the system capacity.**

19. **Consider that a geographical service area of a cellular system is 4200 km². A total of 1001 radio channels are available for handling traffic. Suppose the area of a cell is 12 km².**  
    - (a) **How many times would the cluster of size 7 have to be replicated to cover the entire service area? Calculate the number of channels per cell and the system capacity.**  
    - (b) **If the cluster size is decreased from 7 to 4, does it result in an increase in system capacity?**  
    _Comment on the results obtained._
