8. **Calculate the number of times the cluster of size 4 has to be replicated in order to approximately cover the entire service area of 1765 km² with the adequate number of uniform-sized cells of 7 km² each.**

To determine the number of times the cluster of size 4 would have to be replicated to cover the entire service area, we can follow the steps outlined in the sources, specifically `EXAMPLE 4.2 Number of clusters`.

The given parameters are:

- **Size of the cluster (K): 4**
- **Area of a cell (Acell): 7 km²**
- **Total service area (Asystem): 1765 km²**

Here's the calculation:

1. **Calculate the coverage area of a cluster (Acluster):** The coverage area of a cluster is found by multiplying the cluster size (K) by the area of a cell (Acell).
    
    - Acluster = K × Acell
    - Acluster = 4 × 7 km² = **28 km²**
2. **Calculate the number of clusters in the service area (M):** The number of times the cluster has to be replicated to cover the entire service area is determined by dividing the total service area (Asystem) by the area of one cluster (Acluster).
    
    - M = Asystem / Acluster
    - M = 1765 km² / 28 km² ≈ **63 clusters**

Therefore, the cluster of size 4 would have to be replicated approximately **63 times** to cover the entire service area of 1765 km² with uniform-sized cells of 7 km² each.

9. **A mobile communication system is allocated RF spectrum of 25 MHz and uses RF channel bandwidth of 25 kHz so that a total number of 1000 voice channels can be supported in the system.**  
   - (a) **If the service area is divided into 20 cells with a frequency reuse factor of 4, compute the system capacity.**  
   - (b) **The cell size is reduced so that the service area is now covered with 100 cells. Compute the system capacity while keeping the frequency reuse factor as 4.**  
   - (c) **The cell size is further reduced so the same service area is now covered with 700 cells and the frequency reuse factor is 7. Compute the system capacity.**


The common parameters for this mobile communication system are:

- **Total allocated RF spectrum: 25 MHz**
- **RF channel bandwidth: 25 kHz**
- **Total number of voice channels (N): 1000**.
    - This is derived from the allocated spectrum and channel bandwidth: 25 MHz / 25 kHz = 1000 channels.
- **Capacity of a cluster:** In a cellular system based on the frequency-reuse concept, all available channels (N) are allocated uniformly to each cluster. Therefore, the capacity of a cluster is **1000 channels**.

Let's compute the system capacity for each scenario:

**(a) If the service area is divided into 20 cells with a frequency reuse factor of 4:**

1. **Number of cells covering the area:** 20 cells.
2. **Frequency reuse factor (cluster size, K): 4**.
3. **Determine the number of clusters (M):** The number of clusters is calculated by dividing the total number of cells by the cluster size.
    - M = Number of cells / K = 20 / 4 = **5 clusters**.
4. **Compute the system capacity (C):** The overall system capacity (C) is theoretically determined by multiplying the total number of channels allocated to a cluster (N) by the number of clusters in the system (M).
    - C = N × M = 1000 channels/cluster × 5 clusters = **5000 channels**.

**(b) The cell size is reduced so that the service area is now covered with 100 cells, keeping the frequency reuse factor as 4:**

1. **Number of cells covering the area:** 100 cells.
2. **Frequency reuse factor (cluster size, K): 4**.
3. **Determine the new number of clusters (M):**
    - M = Number of cells / K = 100 / 4 = **25 clusters**.
4. **Compute the new system capacity (C):**
    - C = N × M = 1000 channels/cluster × 25 clusters = **25,000 channels**.

**(c) The cell size is further reduced so the same service area is now covered with 700 cells and the frequency reuse factor is 7:**

1. **Number of cells covering the area:** 700 cells.
2. **Frequency reuse factor (cluster size, K): 7**.
3. **Determine the new number of clusters (M):**
    - M = Number of cells / K = 700 / 7 = **100 clusters**.
4. **Compute the new system capacity (C):**
    - C = N × M = 1000 channels/cluster × 100 clusters = **100,000 channels**.

**Comment on the results obtained:**

The calculations demonstrate a clear relationship between the number of cells, cluster size, and overall system capacity. **Increasing the number of cells covering a given service area significantly increases the system capacity**. This is because a greater number of cells, for a given cluster size, allows for a greater number of clusters to be replicated across the service area. Each cluster contains the full set of available channels, so more clusters directly lead to higher overall capacity.

For instance, by increasing the number of cells from 20 to 100 while keeping the cluster size at 4, the system capacity increased five-fold (from 5,000 to 25,000 channels). Further increasing the number of cells to 700, even with a larger cluster size of 7, resulted in a substantial increase to 100,000 channels, showing the dramatic impact of cell division and frequency reuse on system capacity.

The principle of **frequency reuse** is core to this capacity enhancement. However, there is a trade-off: minimizing the cluster size (K) maximizes capacity, but it also increases **cochannel interference** because cochannel cells (cells using the same frequencies) are located closer together. Therefore, the selection of the frequency reuse factor (K) is a critical design trade-off, balancing the desire for high capacity with the need to maintain an acceptable level of signal-to-cochannel interference and ensure desired signal quality.

10. **Consider that a geographical service area of a cellular system is 4200 km². A total of 1001 radio channels are available for handling traffic. Suppose the area of a cell is 12 km².**  
    - (a) **How many times would the cluster of size 7 have to be replicated to cover the entire service area? Calculate the number of channels per cell and the system capacity.**  
    - (b) **If the cluster size is decreased from 7 to 4, does it result in an increase in system capacity?**  
    _Comment on the results obtained._

The given parameters for the cellular system are:

- **Geographical service area (Asys): 4200 km²**
- **Total radio channels (N): 1001**
- **Area of a cell (Acell): 12 km²**

Let's break down the calculations:

**(a) Cluster of size 7 (K = 7):**

1. **Coverage area of a cluster:** The coverage area of a cluster is calculated by multiplying the cluster size (K) by the area of a cell (Acell).
    
    - Area of a cluster (Acluster) = K × Acell = 7 × 12 km² = **84 km²**.
2. **Number of times the cluster would have to be replicated:** This is determined by dividing the total geographical service area (Asys) by the area of one cluster (Acluster).
    
    - Number of clusters (M) = Asys / Acluster = 4200 km² / 84 km² = **50 clusters**.
3. **Number of channels per cell:** The number of channels per cell (J, or cell capacity) is found by dividing the total number of available channels (N) by the cluster size (K).
    
    - Number of channels per cell (J) = N / K = 1001 / 7 = **143 channels/cell**.
4. **System capacity:** The overall system capacity (C) is calculated by multiplying the total number of available channels per cluster (N) by the number of clusters in the service area (M).
    
    - System capacity (C) = N × M = 1001 × 50 = **50,050 channels**.

**(b) Decrease in cluster size from 7 to 4 (K = 4):**

1. **Coverage area of the new cluster:** With the reduced cluster size, the new area of a cluster is calculated.
    
    - New Area of a cluster (Acluster) = K × Acell = 4 × 12 km² = **48 km²**.
2. **Increased number of clusters:** With the smaller cluster size, more clusters are needed to cover the same service area.
    
    - New Number of clusters (M) = Asys / Acluster = 4200 km² / 48 km² ≈ **87 clusters**.
3. **New system capacity:** Assuming the total number of available channels per cluster (N) remains 1001, the system capacity increases with more clusters.
    
    - New system capacity (C) = N × M = 1001 × 87 = **87,087 channels** (rounded from 87,000 in source due to precise calculation of 87 clusters).

**Comment on the results obtained:**

The results clearly indicate that **decreasing the cluster size from 7 to 4 significantly increases the system capacity**.

- With a cluster size of 7, the system could support **50,050 channels**.
- By decreasing the cluster size to 4, the system capacity increases to approximately **87,087 channels**.

This increase in capacity is due to the greater number of times the cluster can be replicated to cover the entire service area when the cluster size is smaller. A smaller cluster size means more channels are available per cell.

However, this increase in capacity comes with a trade-off. A lower cluster size (K) means that cochannel cells (cells using the same set of frequencies) are located closer together. This **reduces the frequency reuse distance (D)** for a given cell radius (R), increasing the **average signal-to-cochannel interference**. This increased interference must be maintained at an acceptable level to ensure desired signal quality. Therefore, the choice of the frequency reuse factor (K) needs to balance maximizing capacity with keeping interference within tolerable limits.
