    _Comment on the results obtained._

The given parameters for the cellular system are:

- **Geographical service area (Asys): 4200 km²**
- **Total radio channels (N): 1001**
- **Area of a cell (Acell): 12 km²**

Let's break down the calculations:

**(a) Cluster of size 7 (K = 7):**

1. **Coverage area of a cluster:** The coverage area of a cluster is calculated by multiplying the cluster size (K) by the area of a cell (Acell).
    
    - Area of a cluster (Acluster) = K × Acell = 7 × 12 km² = **84 km²**.
2. **Number of times the cluster would have to be replicated:** This is determined by dividing the total geographical service area (Asys) by the area of one cluster (Acluster).
    
    - Number of clusters (M) = Asys / Acluster = 4200 km² / 84 km² = **50 clusters**.
3. **Number of channels per cell:** The number of channels per cell (J, or cell capacity) is found by dividing the total number of available channels (N) by the cluster size (K).
    
    - Number of channels per cell (J) = N / K = 1001 / 7 = **143 channels/cell**.
4. **System capacity:** The overall system capacity (C) is calculated by multiplying the total number of available channels per cluster (N) by the number of clusters in the service area (M).
    
    - System capacity (C) = N × M = 1001 × 50 = **50,050 channels**.

**(b) Decrease in cluster size from 7 to 4 (K = 4):**

1. **Coverage area of the new cluster:** With the reduced cluster size, the new area of a cluster is calculated.
    
    - New Area of a cluster (Acluster) = K × Acell = 4 × 12 km² = **48 km²**.
2. **Increased number of clusters:** With the smaller cluster size, more clusters are needed to cover the same service area.
    
    - New Number of clusters (M) = Asys / Acluster = 4200 km² / 48 km² ≈ **87 clusters**.
3. **New system capacity:** Assuming the total number of available channels per cluster (N) remains 1001, the system capacity increases with more clusters.
    
    - New system capacity (C) = N × M = 1001 × 87 = **87,087 channels** (rounded from 87,000 in source due to precise calculation of 87 clusters).

**Comment on the results obtained:**

The results clearly indicate that **decreasing the cluster size from 7 to 4 significantly increases the system capacity**.

- With a cluster size of 7, the system could support **50,050 channels**.
- By decreasing the cluster size to 4, the system capacity increases to approximately **87,087 channels**.

This increase in capacity is due to the greater number of times the cluster can be replicated to cover the entire service area when the cluster size is smaller. A smaller cluster size means more channels are available per cell.

However, this increase in capacity comes with a trade-off. A lower cluster size (K) means that cochannel cells (cells using the same set of frequencies) are located closer together. This **reduces the frequency reuse distance (D)** for a given cell radius (R), increasing the **average signal-to-cochannel interference**. This increased interference must be maintained at an acceptable level to ensure desired signal quality. Therefore, the choice of the frequency reuse factor (K) needs to balance maximizing capacity with keeping interference within tolerable limits.
