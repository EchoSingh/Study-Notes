1. **Explain the concept of layered network architecture. Discuss the advantages of using a layered model in communication networks.**  
---

2. **Describe the seven layers of the OSI model with their functions. Use a diagram to illustrate how data is encapsulated and decapsulated across layers.**  
---

3. **Compare the OSI and TCP/IP models in terms of architecture, functionality, and layer responsibilities.**  
---

4. **Explain the TCP/IP protocol suite. Describe the functions of each layer and list the common protocols associated with each layer.**  
---

5. **What is addressing in networking? Explain physical, logical, port, and specific addressing with examples.**  
---

6. **Explain the concept of process-to-process delivery. How does the Transport Layer ensure reliable communication between applications?**  
---

7. **What is UDP? Compare and contrast UDP with TCP in terms of connection, reliability, speed, and use cases. Provide examples where UDP is preferred.**  
---

8. **Discuss how data is transmitted from a sender to a receiver through the OSI model. Include roles of each layer and the addressing used in each stage.**  
---

9. **Analyze a real-time application scenario (e.g., video streaming or online gaming). Justify the use of UDP over TCP for this application.**  
---

10. **With a neat diagram, explain how the Transport Layer in the TCP/IP model handles process-to-process communication using port numbers and headers.**
